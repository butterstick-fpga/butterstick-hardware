### Variants

The ButterStick is offered with two variants, a cheaper version with the smallest ECP5 and a fully loaded variant, featuring the largest 85F ECP5.

The part changes between the two variants are listed in the table below.

|      | ButterStick-r1.0-2G-25F | ButterStick-r1.0-8G-85F | 
|------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| FPGA | LFE5UM5G-25F-8BG381C    | LFE5UM5G-85F-8BG381C    | 
| DDR3 | 2x MT41K64M16TW-107     | 2x MT41K256M16TW-107    |

The 25F also has the following limitations on the ButterStick:
* 25F Only provides 2x SERDES lanes.
* 25F does not connect I/O pins S8/S9 on SYZYGY.C
